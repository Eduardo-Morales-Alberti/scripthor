# Metadrop Composer Scripthor

## Scripthor toolset

This is a swiss knife of scripts for speed up the development on drupal projects.

Works with drupal 8+ projects.

## Usage

Drupal Composer Scripthor is used by requiring `composer require metadrop/scripthor`
in your project project.

Typically, the scaffold operations run automatically as needed, e.g. after
`composer install`, so it is usually not necessary to do anything different
to scaffold a project once the configuration is set up in the project
composer.json file, as described below. To scripthor files directly, run:

### Scripthor create symlinks

```
composer scripthor:create-symlinks
```
